I’m a <b>Computer Science graduate<b> with a passion for technology and cybersecurity. 

I earned my Bachelor's degree from Università degli Studi di Roma "Tor Vergata," where I built a solid foundation in computing and software development. 

Currently, I’m completing my Master's degree in Cybersecurity at Sapienza University of Rome, further honing my skills in protecting digital infrastructures and data.

My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on projects—many of which you can explore on my GitHub.
